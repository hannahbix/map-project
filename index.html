		<h1>Mapping changes in U.S. foreign assistance with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic</h1>

				<p>The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in March resulted in a global shutdown. Lockdowns and the disruption of travel and supply chains had a dramatic impact on both the public and private sectors. In the public sector, this includes U.S. foreign assistance - encompassing all kinds of aid, both financial and material, to other countries around the world. </p>

				<p>While an incomplete picture, this map highlights the initial ways in which the pandemic impacted U.S. foreign assistance around the world. In the wake of the <a href="https://www.who.int/director-general/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---11-march-2020">World Health Organization's pandemic declaration</a> in March 2020, it appears the U.S. government did respond by changing aid flows:</p>

			<h3> Some highlights:</h3>

			<p> Singapore had the most significant growth in foreign assistance, from just $9,700 reported in 2019, reported as such because there were negative values indicating either a correction or cancellation of funding, to $2,243,411 in 2020. Most of this appears to come from a more than $1 million program through USAID and the State Department, but no additional details or documentation are publicly available. According to the State Department's <a href="https://www.state.gov/countries-areas/singapore/">website</a>, the bulk of U.S. foreign assistance to Singapore is aimed at supporting export and border controls, but it is unclear if this grant correlates to that program. </p>

			<p> New Zealand saw the biggest cut in foreign assistance funding, from $14,238 in 2019 to $-4,707 in 2020 (see note above about negative values in the budget). One potential explanation is that New Zealand, which already received a relatively small amount of U.S. foreign assistance funding, has pursued a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/04/world/australia/new-zealand-covid-zero.html">COVID zero" strategy for most of the pandemic and used agressive lockdowns (to much success) for most of 2020.</a> </p>

			<p> U.S. foreign assistance to Italy grew dramatically from just $629,294 in 2019 to $39,754,963 - a 6,217.39% increase. Italy was one of the first countries to be hard-hit by the pandemic, facing a significant crisis in early April 2020, when <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-italy/trump-orders-u-s-government-to-help-italy-in-coronavirus-fight-idUSKCN21T01V">they requested and the U.S. delivered humanitarian and medical aid</a> to the country. Four other European countries were also in the top 10 for funding increases: Slovakia, Finland, Sweden, and Bulgaria. </p>

			<p> Many countries in Africa and Asia saw a drop in funding. Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea, and other <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02173-z">countries that previously battled Ebola were particularly well-prepared to respond to the pandemic outbreak</a>. While Italy, the United States, China, and other countries were grappling with massive infection rates early in the pandemic, the public health systems in place in these countries - including a mandatory quarantine period for all visitors - meant they were largely spared early on. This could explain why many countries in Africa saw a drop in U.S. foreign assistance during 2020, as the U.S. looked to support struggling allies like Italy.</p>

			<script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();

			<p> As you can see in the regional breakdown above, every region of the world saw a drop in U.S. foreign assistance funding. But from 2019 to 2020, Europe and Eurasia saw the smallest drop in funding. Sub-Saharan Africa, meanwhile, saw the biggest funding cuts. One possible explanation, as noted above, is the change in foreign assistance during the first year of the pandemic to support the countries most impacted at the outset - including many in Europe, whereas African nations were largely spared early on. </p>

			<h3>A note on the data set</h3>

			<p>Recently, and after a push from watchdog and advocacy organizations like the Modernizing Foreign Assistance Network (MFAN), the U.S. government consolidated its foreign assistance funding onto a single website, <a href="https://foreignassistance.gov/data#tab-data-download">ForeignAssistance.gov</a>. With this consolidation, more accurate, timely, and consolidated data is available to analyze U.S. foreign assistance around the world. </p>
